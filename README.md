Extracting Business Card Data with OCR
This is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information includes the company name, card holder name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin code. The application also provides functionality to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. Users can perform Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data through the Streamlit user interface.

**Problem Statement:**

I have been tasked with developing a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR. The extracted information should include the following fields:

Company Name
Card Holder Name
Designation
Mobile Number
Email Address
Website URL
Area
City
State
Pin Code
The application should display the extracted information in a graphical user interface (GUI) that is simple and intuitive. Users should be able to easily add the extracted information to a database along with the uploaded business card image. The application should support storing multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted information.

To achieve this, the application will use Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL. The project requires skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and database management. Good documentation and code organization are also important.

**Approach:**

To develop the Business Card OCR Application, the following approach will be followed:

Install the required packages: Install Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL.

Design the user interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface using Streamlit. The interface will guide users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its information. Widgets like file uploader, buttons, and text boxes will be used to make the interface interactive.

Implement the image processing and OCR: Use easyOCR to extract the relevant information from the uploaded business card image. Image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding can be used to enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.

Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted, display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI. Widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels will be used to present the information.

Implement database integration: Use a database management system like SQLite or MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded business card image. SQL queries will be used to create tables, insert data, retrieve data, update data, and delete data from the database. Users will be able to perform these operations through the Streamlit UI.

Test the application: Thoroughly test the application to ensure it works as expected. The application can be run on a local machine by executing the command streamlit run app.py in the terminal, where app.py is the name of the Streamlit application file.

Improve the application: Continuously improve the application by adding new features, optimizing the code, and fixing bugs. Additional enhancements such as user authentication and authorization can be implemented to enhance security.

**Usage:**

Follow the steps below to use the Business Card OCR Application:

Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the application by executing the command streamlit run app.py in the terminal.

The application will open in your default web browser.

Upload an image of a business card using the file uploader widget.

The application will extract the relevant information from the uploaded image using OCR.

The extracted information will be displayed in the GUI.

Use the provided options to save, update, or delete the extracted information in the database.

Explore the application and its features to manage business card data efficiently.

**Future Enhancements:**

The Business Card OCR Application can be further improved with the following enhancements:

Add user authentication and authorization to secure the application.
Implement data validation to ensure the accuracy of extracted information.
Enhance the OCR engine's accuracy and performance.
Allow users to search and filter the stored business card data.
Enable exporting the extracted information to various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).
Implement data analytics and visualization features for business card data insights.
Feel free to contribute to the application by adding new features or suggesting improvements.

**Conclusion:**

The Business Card OCR Application allows users to extract relevant information from business card images using easyOCR. The application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images, extracting information, and managing the data in a database. It demonstrates the integration of Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database management system to create a scalable, maintainable, and extensible solution. By following the provided usage instructions and considering future enhancements, users can efficiently handle business card data.
